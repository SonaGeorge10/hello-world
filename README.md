## Running the Tests

This project does not use automated testing tools. However, the notebook includes several manual verification steps and outputs.

### Breakdown of Tests

- **Data Integrity Checks**: Null values, data types, and column validation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistical summaries and descriptive metrics.
- **Visual Tests**:
  - Sales trends over time
  - Store-wise performance
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Seasonal variations
- **Database Connectivity Test** (Optional): Uses SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL to interact with a database.
